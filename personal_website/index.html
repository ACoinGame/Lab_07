          <h3>(Feb. 17) Midterm: RIP</h3>
          <p>
            Today is the last day of midterm week. I thought I am prepared
            enough for this HTML midterm, but apparently I am not. I do
            <em>really</em> bad on the midterm. I would not be surprised if I
            don't pass. I'm going to be depressed for the long weekend.

          <h3>(Feb. 19) HTML Midterm: Passed!</h3>
          <p>
            I pass the HTML midterm. I get a higher grade than I expected.
            NickuYou is a lenient marker. We also get additional partial marks
            from some multiple choice questions because Neda is nice. Still, I
            need to give up co-op at this point. I was hoping I can do well on
            all 6 courses to make up comm 1116. It's
            <strong>impossible</strong> for me to do well in comm.
