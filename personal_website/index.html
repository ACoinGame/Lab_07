            <h3>(Feb. 17) Midterm: RIP</h3>
            <p>
              Today is the last day of midterm week. I thought I am prepared
              enough for this HTML midterm, but apparently I am not. I do
              <em>really</em> bad on the midterm. I would not be surprised if I
              don't pass. I'm going to be depressed for the long weekend.

            <h3>(Feb. 19) HTML Midterm: Passed!</h3>
            <p>
              I pass the HTML midterm. I get a higher grade than I expected.
              NickuYou is a lenient marker. We also get additional partial marks
              from some multiple choice questions because Neda is nice. Still, I
              need to give up co-op at this point. I was hoping I can do well on
              all 6 courses to make up comm 1116. It's
              <strong>impossible</strong> for me to do well in comm.
